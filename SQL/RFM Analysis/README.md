# ðŸ’¡ RFM Analysis
Welcome, this page will be about using SQL to create an RFM analysis! 

A cohort table, often used in cohort analysis, is a tool that groups customers (or users) into cohorts based on shared characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span. These characteristics are often their first purchase date or the date they first signed up for a service. The cohort table then tracks and compares the behavior and performance of these groups over time.

The dataset used can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail
DB Used: BigQuery

## Broken Down Code
Step 1: Clean the data where CustomerID is not empty and Quantity and Price is greater than 0. And create TotalSum column by multiplying  Quantity and Unitprice.
```sql
    SELECT 
        *, 
        Quantity * UnitPrice AS TotalSum
    FROM 
        `trans-filament-408113.onlineretaildb.retail` 
    WHERE 
        CustomerID IS NOT NULL 
         AND ((Quantity > 0) AND (UnitPrice > 0))
```

Step 2: Create Recency Column by finding the difference in date between maximum date of the dataset + 1 (since this is a historic dataset) subtracting the latest invoicedate from each customer.Create Frequency Column by couting the amount of times customer has purchased from store. Create MonetaryValue buy summing up the amount of money customer has spent.
```sql
    SELECT 
        CustomerID, 
        DATE_DIFF(
            DATE_ADD((SELECT MAX(InvoiceDate) FROM filtered_df), INTERVAL 1 DAY),
            MAX(InvoiceDate),
            DAY
        ) AS Recency,  
        COUNT(InvoiceNo) AS Frequency,
        SUM(TotalSum) AS MonetaryValue
    FROM 
        filtered_df
    GROUP BY 
        CustomerID
```
Step3: Create 4 bins for Recency,Frequency,and MonetaryValue. 
```sql
    SELECT
        CustomerID,
        Recency,
        Frequency,
        MonetaryValue,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(Recency, 0.25) OVER () AS Recency_1_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(Recency, 0.5) OVER () AS Recency_2_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(Recency, 0.75) OVER () AS Recency_3_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(Recency, 1) OVER () AS Recency_4_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(MonetaryValue, 0.25) OVER () AS MonetaryValue_1_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(MonetaryValue, 0.5) OVER () AS MonetaryValue_2_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(MonetaryValue, 0.75) OVER () AS MonetaryValue_3_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(MonetaryValue, 1) OVER () AS MonetaryValue_4_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(Frequency, 0.25) OVER () AS Frequency_1_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(Frequency, 0.5) OVER () AS Frequency_2_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(Frequency, 0.75) OVER () AS Frequency_3_Quin,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(Frequency, 1) OVER () AS Frequency_4_Quin
    FROM 
        pre_RFM
```
Step 4: Place each customer in each bin by using CASE

```sql
    SELECT
        CustomerID,
        Recency,
        Frequency,
        MonetaryValue,
        (CASE 
            WHEN Recency <= Recency_1_Quin THEN 4
            WHEN Recency > Recency_1_Quin AND Recency <= Recency_2_Quin THEN 3
            WHEN Recency > Recency_2_Quin AND Recency <= Recency_3_Quin THEN 2
            WHEN Recency > Recency_3_Quin AND Recency <= Recency_4_Quin THEN 1
            ELSE 5 
        END) AS Recency_Quantile,
        (CASE 
            WHEN Frequency <= Frequency_1_Quin THEN 1
            WHEN Frequency > Frequency_1_Quin AND Frequency <= Frequency_2_Quin THEN 2
            WHEN Frequency > Frequency_2_Quin AND Frequency <= Frequency_3_Quin THEN 3
            WHEN Frequency > Frequency_3_Quin AND Frequency <= Frequency_4_Quin THEN 4
            ELSE 5 
        END) AS Frequency_Quantile,
        (CASE 
            WHEN MonetaryValue <= MonetaryValue_1_Quin THEN 1
            WHEN MonetaryValue > MonetaryValue_1_Quin AND MonetaryValue <= MonetaryValue_2_Quin THEN 2
            WHEN MonetaryValue > MonetaryValue_2_Quin AND MonetaryValue <= MonetaryValue_3_Quin THEN 3
            WHEN MonetaryValue > MonetaryValue_3_Quin AND MonetaryValue <= MonetaryValue_4_Quin THEN 4
            ELSE 5 
        END) AS Monetary_Value_Quantile
    FROM 
        rfm2
```

Step 5: Create RFM Score by concatenating R,F,M values together and summing the scores together.
```sql
    SELECT 
        *,
        CONCAT(CAST(Recency_Quantile AS STRING), CAST(Frequency_Quantile AS STRING), CAST(Monetary_Value_Quantile AS STRING)) AS RFM_Segment, 
        (Recency_Quantile + Frequency_Quantile + Monetary_Value_Quantile) AS RFM_Score
    FROM 
        rfm_quantile
),
```

Step 6: Distinguishing each customer into different teirs by RFM_Score
```sql
    SELECT
        *,
        CASE 
            WHEN RFM_Score >= 9 THEN 'Gold'
            WHEN RFM_Score BETWEEN 5 AND 9 THEN 'Silver'
            ELSE 'Bronze' 
        END AS Segments
    FROM 
        rfm
```
Step 7: Calculate average values for each tier so we can distinguish the characteristics of each tier.
```sql
SELECT 
    Segments,
    AVG(Recency) AS AVG_Recency,
    AVG(Frequency) AS AVG_Frequency,
    AVG(MonetaryValue) AS AVG_MonetaryValue,
    COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM 
    rfm_segments
GROUP BY 
    Segments
ORDER BY 
    Segments
```
