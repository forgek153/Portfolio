## Business Task
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## Question and Solution

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
In case study 2, we are required to clean the table for analysis

**Table 2: `customer_orders`**

**Table Cleansing Methodology:**

| Column  | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| exclusions         | convert 'null' values to NULL        |
| extras        | convert 'null' values to NULL        |

**New Schema:**
```sql
-- Copying table to new table for Customer Orders
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_orders1;
CREATE TABLE customer_orders1 AS

        customer_id, 
        pizza_id, 
        CASE WHEN exclusions = 'null' THEN NULL ELSE exclusions END AS exclusions,
        CASE WHEN extras = 'null' THEN NULL ELSE extras END AS extras,
        order_time 
    FROM 
        customer_orders
);

-- Define data types for columns in Customer Orders
ALTER TABLE customer_orders1
ALTER COLUMN order_id TYPE INTEGER,
ALTER COLUMN customer_id TYPE INTEGER,

## A. Pizza Metrics

**1. How many pizzas were ordered?**
```sql
    SELECT Count(order_id) AS pizzas_ordered
    FROM   pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```

| pizzas_ordered |
| -------------- |
| 14             |

**2. How many unique customer orders were made?**
```sql
    SELECT Count(distinct order_id) AS unique_pizzas_ordered
    FROM   pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```
| unique_pizzas_ordered |
| --------------------- |
| 10                    |

**3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**
```sql
    SELECT runner_id,
           Count(order_id) AS OrdersDelivered
    FROM   pizza_runner.runner_orders1
    WHERE  distance IS NOT NULL
    GROUP  BY runner_id
    ORDER  BY ordersdelivered DESC;
```
| runner_id | ordersdelivered |
| --------- | --------------- |
| 1         | 4               |
| 2         | 3               |
| 3         | 1               |


**4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**
```sql
    SELECT pizza_names.pizza_name,
           Count(customer_orders1.pizza_id) AS TotalDelivered
    FROM   pizza_runner.customer_orders1
           INNER JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders1
                   ON customer_orders1.order_id = runner_orders1.order_id
           INNER JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names
                   ON pizza_names.pizza_id = customer_orders1.pizza_id
    WHERE  runner_orders1.distance IS NOT NULL
    GROUP  BY customer_orders1.pizza_id,
              pizza_names.pizza_name;
```
| pizza_name | totaldelivered |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Meatlovers | 9              |
| Vegetarian | 3              |

**5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**
```sql
    SELECT customer_orders1.customer_id,
           pizza_names.pizza_name,
           Count(customer_orders1.pizza_id) AS TotalPizzaOrdered
    FROM   pizza_runner.customer_orders1
           INNER JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names
                   ON customer_orders1.pizza_id = pizza_names.pizza_id
    GROUP  BY customer_orders1.customer_id,
              pizza_names.pizza_name
    ORDER  BY customer_orders1.customer_id;
```

```sql
    SELECT Sum(CASE
                 WHEN pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 12
                 ELSE 10
               END) AS revenue
    FROM   pizza_runner.customer_orders1
           JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names
             ON ( customer_orders1.pizza_id = pizza_names.pizza_id )
           JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders1
             ON ( customer_orders1.order_id = runner_orders1.order_id )
    WHERE  distance > 0;

```

| revenue |
| ----- |
| 138   |

2.    What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
        *Add cheese is $1 extra
```sql
    WITH cte
         AS (SELECT ( Unnest(String_to_array(extras, ',')) :: INTEGER ) AS
                    revenue_per_extra
             FROM   pizza_runner.customer_orders1
                    join pizza_runner.pizza_names
                      ON ( customer_orders1.pizza_id = pizza_names.pizza_id )
                    join pizza_runner.runner_orders1
                      ON ( customer_orders1.order_id = runner_orders1.order_id )
             WHERE  distance > 0)
    SELECT 138 + Count(revenue_per_extra) AS revenue
    FROM   cte;
```
| revenue |
| ------- |
| 142     |


3.    The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

```sql
    insert into ratings
    (order_id, rating)
    values
    (1,3),
    (2,5),
    (3,3),
    (4,1),
    (5,5),
    (7,3),
    (8,4),
    (10,3);

    select * from
    pizza_runner.ratings;
```
| order_id | rating |
| -------- | ------ |
| 1        | 3      |
| 2        | 5      |
| 3        | 3      |
| 4        | 1      |
| 5        | 5      |
| 7        | 3      |
| 8        | 4      |
| 10       | 3      |

4.    Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
        customer_id
        order_id
        runner_id
        rating
        order_time
        pickup_time
        Time between order and pickup
        Delivery duration
        Average speed
        Total number of pizzas



5.    If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

```sql
    SELECT 138 - ( Sum(distance) ) * 0.3 AS Finalamount
    FROM   pizza_runner.runner_orders1;

```
| finalamount       |
| ----------------- |
| 94.44|
