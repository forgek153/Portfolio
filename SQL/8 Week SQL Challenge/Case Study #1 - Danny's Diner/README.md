## Solution

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_id,
                    Sum(price) AS total_price
    FROM   dannys_diner.sales
           JOIN dannys_diner.menu
             ON ( sales.product_id = menu.product_id )
    GROUP  BY customer_id
    ORDER  BY customer_id;
```
| customer_id | total_price |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
