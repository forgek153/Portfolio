## Business Task
Danny launched a new initiative, Data Bank which runs **banking activities** and also acts as the world‚Äôs most secure distributed **data storage platform**!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. 

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

**Table 1: `regions`**

This regions table contains the `region_id` and their respective `region_name` values.

**Table 2: `customer_nodes`**

Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their region. This random distribution changes frequently to reduce the risk of hackers getting into Data Bank‚Äôs system and stealing customer‚Äôs money and data!

## Question and Solution


## üè¶ A. Customer Nodes Exploration

1.    How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
```sql
    SELECT Count (DISTINCT node_id)
    FROM   data_bank.customer_nodes;
```
| count |
| ----- |
| 5     |

2.    What is the number of nodes per region?
```sql
    SELECT region_name,
               Count(distinct node_id)
        FROM   data_bank.customer_nodes
               JOIN data_bank.regions
                 ON( customer_nodes.region_id = regions.region_id )
        GROUP  BY region_name;
```
| region_name | count |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Africa      | 5     |
| America     | 5     |
| Asia        | 5     |
| Australia   | 5     |
| Europe      | 5     |


3.    How many customers are allocated to each region?
```sql
    SELECT region_name,
           Count(distinct customer_id)
    FROM   data_bank.customer_nodes
           JOIN data_bank.regions
             ON( customer_nodes.region_id = regions.region_id )
    GROUP  BY region_name;
```
| region_name | count |
| ----------- | ----- |

4.    How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
```sql
    WITH cte
         AS (SELECT node_id,
                    Lead(node_id, 1)
                      OVER(
                        partition BY customer_id) AS new_node,
                    start_date,
                    end_date
             FROM   data_bank.customer_nodes

                      ON( customer_nodes.region_id = regions.region_id )
             WHERE  Extract(year FROM end_date) <> 9999)
    SELECT
    
    	PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY end_date - start_date) AS median,
        
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY end_date - start_date) AS Eighty,
    
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY end_date - start_date) AS NinetyFive
    FROM
